# Mirthhe's portfolio website repository üçÄ 

## ‚ùó Introduction

This repository contains the files used for [Mirthhe's portfolio website](mirthhe.github.io). When changes are done in the behind the scenes environment they will be checked before they're brought over to this repository. This way the website stays clean and organized. My portfolio mainly consists of assignments given in the [DSFB2-Workflows course](https://lesmaterialen.rstudio.hu.nl/workflows-reader/#course-introduction) from the University of Applied Sciences in Utrecht. As my career and skills develop it will expand to better show what I am capable of. Feedback on any of my work is always welcomed.

## üé® Styling

When it comes to the styling of the website, the bookdown package comes with default styling. Since the default does not match my personal style I adjusted a few minor details, like colors and fonts. The fonts used are google fonts [Karla](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Karla) and [Tajawal](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Tajawal) for a softer overall look compared to the default. The colorscheme was inspired by the header image on the index page. Aside from that, minor changes have been made like aligning the bottom-border of the sidebarheader with that of the toolbar and making the space above and below a code chunk the same height. More changes might be added.

## üö¢ Portrobbo package

An important part of this portfolio and of the assignments is the R package created for the portfolio. It is called portrobbo and more info on it can be found [here](https://github.com/mirthhe/portrobbo).
