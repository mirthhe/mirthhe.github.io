Spanish flu in 1918, Asian flu in 1957, Hong Kong flu in 1968 and swine flu in 2009 were known pandemic which had various characteristics in terms of morbidity and mortality. A current pandemic is caused by novel corona virus originated from China. COVID-19 pandemic is very similar to Spanish, Hong Kong, Asian and swine influenza pandemics in terms of spreading to world by the mobilized people. Burden of pandemic is considered in terms of disease transmissibility and the growth rate of epidemic and duration of pandemic can be calculated by transmissibility characteristic. The case definition, finding out cases and first case cluster, proper treatment, sufficient stockpiles of medicine and population cooperation with the containment strategy should be considered for reduction of burden of pandemic.},

  abstract = {Host-associated microbiotas guide the trajectory of developmental programs, and altered microbiota composition is linked to neurodevelopmental conditions such as autism spectrum disorder. Recent work suggests that microbiotas modulate behavioral phenotypes associated with these disorders. We discovered that the zebrafish microbiota is required for normal social behavior and reveal a molecular pathway linking the microbiota, microglial remodeling of neural circuits, and social behavior in this experimentally tractable model vertebrate. Examining neuronal correlates of behavior, we found that the microbiota restrains neurite complexity and targeting of forebrain neurons required for normal social behavior and is necessary for localization of forebrain microglia, brain-resident phagocytes that remodel neuronal arbors. The microbiota also influences microglial molecular functions, including promoting expression of the complement signaling pathway and the synaptic remodeling factor c1q. Several distinct bacterial taxa are individually sufficient for normal microglial and neuronal phenotypes, suggesting that host neuroimmune development is sensitive to a feature common among many bacteria. Our results demonstrate that the microbiota influences zebrafish social behavior by stimulating microglial remodeling of forebrain circuits during early neurodevelopment and suggest pathways for new interventions in multiple neurodevelopmental disorders.},

  abstract = {RATIONALE: Amphetamine challenge in rodent prepulse inhibition (PPI) studies has been used to model potential dopamine involvement in effects that may be relevant to schizophrenia, though similar studies in healthy humans have failed to report replicable or robust effects. OBJECTIVES: The present study investigated dexamphetamine effects on PPI in healthy humans with an increased dose and a range of startling stimulus intensities to determine participants' sensitivity and range of responses to the stimuli. METHODS: A randomised, placebo-controlled dexamphetamine (0.45 mg/kg, per os.), double-blind, counterbalanced, within-subject design was used. PPI was measured in 64 participants across a range of startling stimulus intensities, during two attention set conditions (ATTEND and IGNORE). Startle magnitudes for pulse-alone and prepulse-pulse magnitudes were modelled using the startle reflex magnitude (sigmoid) function. Parameters were extracted from these fits, including the upper limit of the asymptote (maximum startle reflex capacity, R MAX), intensity threshold, stimulus intensity that elicits a half-maximal response (ES50) and the maximum rate of change of startle response magnitude to an increase in stimulus intensity. RESULTS: Dexamphetamine increased the threshold and ES50 of the response to pulse-alone trials in both sexes and reduced R MAX exclusively in females. Dexamphetamine modestly increased PPI of the R MAX across both attention conditions. PPI of R MAX was reduced during the ATTEND condition compared to the IGNORE condition. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that sex differences exist in motor, but not sensory, components of the startle reflex. Findings also reveal that administration of 0.45 mg/kg dexamphetamine to healthy humans does not mimic PPI effects observed in schizophrenia.},

The research activities of the Grafstr\"om laboratory have, for many years, covered cancer biology studies, as well as the development and application of toxicity-predictive in vitro models to determine chemical safety. Through the integration of in silico analyses of diverse types of genomics data (transcriptomic and proteomic), their efforts have proved to fit well into the recently-developed Adverse Outcome Pathway paradigm. Genomics analysis within state-of-the-art cancer biology research and Toxicology in the 21st Century concepts share many technological tools. A key category within the Three Rs paradigm is the Replacement of animals in toxicity testing with alternative methods, such as bioinformatics-driven analyses of data obtained from human cell cultures exposed to diverse toxicants. This work was recently expanded within the pan-European SEURAT-1 project (Safety Evaluation Ultimately Replacing Animal Testing), to replace repeat-dose toxicity testing with data-rich analyses of sophisticated cell culture models. The aims and objectives of the SEURAT project have been to guide the application, analysis, interpretation and storage of 'omics' technology-derived data within the service-oriented sub-project, ToxBank. Particularly addressing the Lush Science Prize focus on the relevance of toxicity pathways, a 'data warehouse' that is under continuous expansion, coupled with the development of novel data storage and management methods for toxicology, serve to address data integration across multiple 'omics' technologies. The prize winners' guiding principles and concepts for modern knowledge management of toxicological data are summarised. The translation of basic discovery results ranged from chemical-testing and material-testing data, to information relevant to human health and environmental safety.},

  abstract = {Dengue is an arthropod-borne infectious disease caused by dengue virus (DENV) infection and transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. Approximately 50-100 million people are infected with DENV each year, resulting in a high economic burden on both governments and individuals. Here, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize information regarding the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, and serotype distribution and risk factors for global dengue outbreaks occurring from 1990 to 2015. We searched the PubMed, Embase and Web of Science databases through December 2016 using the term "dengue outbreak." In total, 3,853 studies were identified, of which 243 studies describing 262 dengue outbreaks met our inclusion criteria. The majority of outbreak-associated dengue cases were reported in the Western Pacific Region, particularly after the year 2010; these cases were primarily identified in China, Singapore and Malaysia. The pooled mean age of dengue-infected individuals was 30.1 years; of the included patients, 54.5\% were male, 23.2\% had DHF, 62.0\% had secondary infections, and 1.3\% died. The mean age of dengue patients reported after 2010 was older than that of patients reported before 2010 (34.0 vs. 27.2 years); however, the proportions of patients who had DHF, had secondary infections and died significantly decreased after 2010. Fever, malaise, headache, and asthenia were the most frequently reported clinical symptoms and signs among dengue patients. In addition, among the identified clinical symptoms and signs, positive tourniquet test (OR = 4.86), ascites (OR = 13.91) and shock (OR = 308.09) were identified as the best predictors of dengue infection, DHF and mortality, respectively (both P {$<$} 0.05). The main risk factors for dengue infection, DHF and mortality were living with uncovered water container (OR = 1.65), suffering from hypotension (OR = 6.18) and suffering from diabetes mellitus (OR = 2.53), respectively (all P {$<$} 0.05). The serotype distribution varied with time and across WHO regions. Overall, co-infections were reported in 47.7\% of the evaluated outbreaks, and the highest pooled mortality rate (2.0\%) was identified in DENV-2 dominated outbreaks. Our study emphasizes the necessity of implementing programs focused on targeted prevention, early identification, and effective treatment.},

OBJECTIVE: To assess lisdexamfetamine dimesylate maintenance of efficacy in adults with moderate to severe binge-eating disorder. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A multinational, phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal study including 418 participants was conducted at 49 clinical research study sites from January 27, 2014, to April 8, 2015. Eligible adults met DSM-IV-R binge-eating disorder criteria and had moderate to severe binge eating disorder ({$\geq$}3 binge-eating days per week for 14 days before open-label baseline; Clinical Global Impressions-Severity [CGI-S] scores {$\geq$}4 [moderate severity] at screening and open-label baseline). Following a 12-week, open-label phase (dose optimization, 4 weeks [lisdexamfetamine dimesylate, 50 or 70 mg]; dose maintenance, 8 weeks), lisdexamfetamine responders ({$\leq$}1 binge eating day per week for 4 consecutive weeks and CGI-S scores {$\leq$}2 at week 12) were randomized to placebo or continued lisdexamfetamine during a 26-week, double-blind, randomized withdrawal phase. INTERVENTIONS: Lisdexamfetamine administration. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome variable, time to relapse ({$\geq$}2 binge-eating days per week for 2 consecutive weeks and {$\geq$}2-point CGI-S score increases from randomized withdrawal baseline), was analyzed using a log-rank test (primary analysis); the analysis was stratified for dichotomized 4-week cessation status. Safety assessments included treatment-emergent adverse events. RESULTS: Of the 418 participants enrolled in the open-label phase of the study, 411 (358 [87.1\%] women; mean [SD] age, 38.3 [10.4] years) were included in the safety analysis set. Of 275 randomized lisdexamfetamine responders (placebo, n\,=\,138; lisdexamfetamine, n\,=\,137), the observed proportions of participants meeting relapse criteria were 3.7\% (5 of 136) for lisdexamfetamine and 32.1\% (42 of 131) for placebo. Lisdexamfetamine demonstrated superiority over placebo on the log-rank test ({$\chi$}21, 40.37; P\,{$<$}\,.001) for time to relapse; the hazard ratio, based on a Cox proportional hazards model for lisdexamfetamine vs placebo, was 0.09 (95\% CI, 0.04-0.23). The treatment-emergent adverse events observed were generally consistent with the known profile of lisdexamfetamine. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Risk of binge-eating relapse over 6 months was lower in participants continuing lisdexamfetamine than in those randomized to placebo. The hazard for relapse was lower with lisdexamfetamine than placebo. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02009163.},

Through an enormous experimental effort\textendash, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences,. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence\textemdash the structure prediction component of the `protein folding problem'\textemdash has been an important open research problem for more than 50~years. Despite recent progress\textendash, existing methods fall far~short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14), demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm., AlphaFold predicts protein structures with an accuracy competitive with experimental structures in the majority of cases using a novel deep learning architecture.},

It is caused by any of the 4 serotypes of dengue virus and is transmitted within humans through female Aedes mosquitoes. Dengue disease varies from mild fever to severe conditions of dengue hemorrhagic fever and shock syndrome. Globalization, increased air travel, and unplanned urbanization have led to increase in the rate of infection and helped dengue to expand its geographic and demographic distribution. Dengue vaccine development has been a challenging task due to the existence of four antigenically distinct dengue virus serotypes, each capable of eliciting cross-reactive and disease-enhancing antibody response against the remaining three serotypes. Recently, Sanofi Pasteur's chimeric live-attenuated dengue vaccine candidate has been approved in Mexico, Brazil, and Philippines for usage in adults between 9 and 45 years of age. The impact of its limited application to the public health system needs to be evaluated. Simultaneously, the restricted application of this vaccine candidate warrants continued efforts in developing a dengue vaccine candidate which is additionally efficacious for infants and na\"ive individuals. In this context, alternative strategies of developing a designed vaccine candidate which does not allow production of enhancing antibodies should be explored, as it may expand the umbrella of efficacy to include infants and na\"ive individuals.},

According to the quarantine sub-periods, there were differences in psychological well-being/discomfort, social functioning and coping, psychological distress, and negative alcohol-related consequences. Negative alcohol-related consequences were the only MHS indicator improving over time. For all of the remaining MHS indicators, we found a similar deterioration pattern in the course of time, with mean scores decreasing from the first to the 2nd week of the quarantine pre-extensions, then increasing toward the 1st week of the quarantine post-extension (with some MHS indicators reaching mean scores worse than the start), and then continued to increase.Conclusion: A worsened mean MHS during quarantine suggests that quarantine and its extensions contribute to negative mental health impacts.},

Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses 6(1), 11\textendash 24.,  Background\hspace{0.6em} To help understand the potential impact of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic in Africa, we reviewed published data from Africa of the two previous influenza pandemics.,  Methods\hspace{0.6em} We conducted a systematic search of three biomedical databases for articles in any language on 1957 H2N2 or 1968 H3N2 pandemic influenza virus infection in Africa published from January 1950 through August 2008.,  Results\hspace{0.6em} We identified 1327 potentially relevant articles, and 298 warranted further review. Fourteen studies on 1968 H3N2 influenza met inclusion criteria, while two studies identified describing 1957 H2N2 were excluded for data limitations. Among these 14 studies, community attack rates for symptomatic infection during all 1968 pandemic waves were around 20\%. However, the proportion infected in communities ranged from 6\% in isolated communities to 100\% in enclosed populations. A total of 22\textendash 64\% of sampled clinic patients and 8\textendash 72\% of hospitalized patients had evidence of 1968 H3N2 virus infection. After the second pandemic wave, up to 41\textendash 75\% of persons tested had serological evidence of 1968 H3N2 virus infection.,  Conclusion\hspace{0.6em} The 1968 H3N2 influenza pandemic, generally regarded as mild worldwide, appears to have had a substantial impact upon public health in Africa. Without more epidemiologic data the impact of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic in Africa cannot be assumed to have been mild. Assessment of the burden of 2009 H1N1 virus and future influenza pandemics in Africa should attempt to assess disease impact by a variety of methods, including substudies among specific populations.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine concordance between treatment effects in animal experiments and clinical trials. Study design Systematic review. DATA SOURCES: Medline, Embase, SIGLE, NTIS, Science Citation Index, CAB, BIOSIS. STUDY SELECTION: Animal studies for interventions with unambiguous evidence of a treatment effect (benefit or harm) in clinical trials: head injury, antifibrinolytics in haemorrhage, thrombolysis in acute ischaemic stroke, tirilazad in acute ischaemic stroke, antenatal corticosteroids to prevent neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, and bisphosphonates to treat osteoporosis. Review methods Data were extracted on study design, allocation concealment, number of randomised animals, type of model, intervention, and outcome. RESULTS: Corticosteroids did not show any benefit in clinical trials of treatment for head injury but did show a benefit in animal models (pooled odds ratio for adverse functional outcome 0.58, 95\% confidence interval 0.41 to 0.83). Antifibrinolytics reduced bleeding in clinical trials but the data were inconclusive in animal models. Thrombolysis improved outcome in patients with ischaemic stroke. In animal models, tissue plasminogen activator reduced infarct volume by 24\% (95\% confidence interval 20\% to 28\%) and improved neurobehavioural scores by 23\% (17\% to 29\%). Tirilazad was associated with a worse outcome in patients with ischaemic stroke. In animal models, tirilazad reduced infarct volume by 29\% (21\% to 37\%) and improved neurobehavioural scores by 48\% (29\% to 67\%). Antenatal corticosteroids reduced respiratory distress and mortality in neonates whereas in animal models respiratory distress was reduced but the effect on mortality was inconclusive (odds ratio 4.2, 95\% confidence interval 0.85 to 20.9). Bisphosphonates increased bone mineral density in patients with osteoporosis. In animal models the bisphosphonate alendronate increased bone mineral density compared with placebo by 11.0\% (95\% confidence interval 9.2\% to 12.9\%) in the combined results for the hip region. The corresponding treatment effect in the lumbar spine was 8.5\% (5.8\% to 11.2\%) and in the combined results for the forearms (baboons only) was 1.7\% (-1.4\% to 4.7\%). CONCLUSIONS: Discordance between animal and human studies may be due to bias or to the failure of animal models to mimic clinical disease adequately.},

  abstract = {The use of nonhuman animals (hereinafter ``animals'') for the benefit of humans and other animals is a contentious subject throughout many of the world's countries. Cultural morals and traditions, the status of animals in various religions, individual and cultural ethical values, and the diversity of concern for specific species (including the perceptions about the ``warm and fuzzies'' [e.g., dogs and cats] versus the ``creepy-crawlies'' [e.g., mice, rats, and reptiles]) all contribute significantly to the complexity of addressing moral (rightness or wrongness) and ethical (what ought to be) issues involved when considering the use of animals in biomedical research, teaching, and testing activities (hereinafter ``biomedical activities''). Further, it is most certainly difficult, if not impossible, to define what the moral status of sentient animals (species that can feel pain and suffer), creatures that are not persons yet not mere things, should be that would be universally accepted. These factors also contribute to the complexity of the regulatory climate in the numerous countries in which there is some sort of oversight of animal use in biomedical activities (see Attachment I for examples of U.S. laws, regulations, and guidelines and the list of worldwide regulations [excluding the United States] compiled by AAALAC International) (AAALAC International 2015).},

  abstract = {RATIONALE: In party circuits dexamphetamine is frequently used in combination with alcohol. It is hypothesized that co-administration of dexamphetamine to alcohol might reduce the sedative effects of alcohol, but may potentiate risk-taking behaviour. OBJECTIVES: The study was aimed at assessing the effects of alcohol, dexamphetamine and the combination of both on simulated driving and cognitive performance. METHOD: Eighteen subjects participated in a randomized, crossover, placebo-controlled study employing four conditions: 10 mg dexamphetamine, 0.8 g/kg alcohol, 10 mg dexamphetamine + 0.8 g/kg alcohol, and placebo. Fundamental driving skills and risk-taking behaviour were assessed in a driving simulator. Subjects also completed vigilance and divided attention tasks, and subjective ratings. RESULTS: Mean BAC levels during simulated driving were between 0.91\textperthousand{} and 0.64\textperthousand. Subjects using alcohol showed a significantly larger mean standard deviation of lateral position and shorter accepted gap time and distance. Use of alcohol or dexamphetamine + alcohol was associated with a higher frequency of red light running and collisions than the dexamphetamine or placebo conditions. Performance of vigilance and divided attention tasks was significantly impaired in the alcohol condition and, to a lesser degree, in the dexamphetamine + alcohol condition. CONCLUSION: Single doses of 0.8 g/kg alcohol increased risk-taking behaviours and impaired tracking, attention and reaction time during a 3-h period after drinking when BACs declined from 0.9 to 0.2 mg/ml. The stimulatory effects of co-administration of dexamphetamine 10 mg were not sufficient to overcome the impairing effects of alcohol on skills related to driving.},

  abstract = {The classification of dengue virus-infected patients continues to be a challenge to researchers and clinicians in the field. The accuracy of the 1997 World Health Organization (WHO) dengue case definition has been debated for a decade, because the definition was very stringent, for instance, several researchers showed that apparently severe cases were misclassified as not severe. Therefore the WHO issued revised guidelines in 2009. Here, we retrospectively compared the performance of the WHO case definition of 2009 with the WHO case definition of 1997 in a detailed documented pediatric cohort from Indonesia. Intensive treatment intervention was used as an indicator of severity of disease. In line with our expectations, the 2009 WHO case classification proved to be significantly more specific, albeit less sensitive than the WHO case classification of 1997. We conclude that the revised classification is promising both from research and clinical perspectives, but validation of the classification criteria still needs to be addressed.},
