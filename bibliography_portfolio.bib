  abstract = {Host-associated microbiotas guide the trajectory of developmental programs, and altered microbiota composition is linked to neurodevelopmental conditions such as autism spectrum disorder. Recent work suggests that microbiotas modulate behavioral phenotypes associated with these disorders. We discovered that the zebrafish microbiota is required for normal social behavior and reveal a molecular pathway linking the microbiota, microglial remodeling of neural circuits, and social behavior in this experimentally tractable model vertebrate. Examining neuronal correlates of behavior, we found that the microbiota restrains neurite complexity and targeting of forebrain neurons required for normal social behavior and is necessary for localization of forebrain microglia, brain-resident phagocytes that remodel neuronal arbors. The microbiota also influences microglial molecular functions, including promoting expression of the complement signaling pathway and the synaptic remodeling factor c1q. Several distinct bacterial taxa are individually sufficient for normal microglial and neuronal phenotypes, suggesting that host neuroimmune development is sensitive to a feature common among many bacteria. Our results demonstrate that the microbiota influences zebrafish social behavior by stimulating microglial remodeling of forebrain circuits during early neurodevelopment and suggest pathways for new interventions in multiple neurodevelopmental disorders.},

  abstract = {RATIONALE: Amphetamine challenge in rodent prepulse inhibition (PPI) studies has been used to model potential dopamine involvement in effects that may be relevant to schizophrenia, though similar studies in healthy humans have failed to report replicable or robust effects. OBJECTIVES: The present study investigated dexamphetamine effects on PPI in healthy humans with an increased dose and a range of startling stimulus intensities to determine participants' sensitivity and range of responses to the stimuli. METHODS: A randomised, placebo-controlled dexamphetamine (0.45 mg/kg, per os.), double-blind, counterbalanced, within-subject design was used. PPI was measured in 64 participants across a range of startling stimulus intensities, during two attention set conditions (ATTEND and IGNORE). Startle magnitudes for pulse-alone and prepulse-pulse magnitudes were modelled using the startle reflex magnitude (sigmoid) function. Parameters were extracted from these fits, including the upper limit of the asymptote (maximum startle reflex capacity, R MAX), intensity threshold, stimulus intensity that elicits a half-maximal response (ES50) and the maximum rate of change of startle response magnitude to an increase in stimulus intensity. RESULTS: Dexamphetamine increased the threshold and ES50 of the response to pulse-alone trials in both sexes and reduced R MAX exclusively in females. Dexamphetamine modestly increased PPI of the R MAX across both attention conditions. PPI of R MAX was reduced during the ATTEND condition compared to the IGNORE condition. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that sex differences exist in motor, but not sensory, components of the startle reflex. Findings also reveal that administration of 0.45 mg/kg dexamphetamine to healthy humans does not mimic PPI effects observed in schizophrenia.},

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE: The ability of pharmacotherapies to prevent relapse and maintain efficacy with long-term treatment in psychiatric conditions is important. OBJECTIVE: To assess lisdexamfetamine dimesylate maintenance of efficacy in adults with moderate to severe binge-eating disorder. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A multinational, phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal study including 418 participants was conducted at 49 clinical research study sites from January 27, 2014, to April 8, 2015. Eligible adults met DSM-IV-R binge-eating disorder criteria and had moderate to severe binge eating disorder ({$\geq$}3 binge-eating days per week for 14 days before open-label baseline; Clinical Global Impressions-Severity [CGI-S] scores {$\geq$}4 [moderate severity] at screening and open-label baseline). Following a 12-week, open-label phase (dose optimization, 4 weeks [lisdexamfetamine dimesylate, 50 or 70 mg]; dose maintenance, 8 weeks), lisdexamfetamine responders ({$\leq$}1 binge eating day per week for 4 consecutive weeks and CGI-S scores {$\leq$}2 at week 12) were randomized to placebo or continued lisdexamfetamine during a 26-week, double-blind, randomized withdrawal phase. INTERVENTIONS: Lisdexamfetamine administration. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome variable, time to relapse ({$\geq$}2 binge-eating days per week for 2 consecutive weeks and {$\geq$}2-point CGI-S score increases from randomized withdrawal baseline), was analyzed using a log-rank test (primary analysis); the analysis was stratified for dichotomized 4-week cessation status. Safety assessments included treatment-emergent adverse events. RESULTS: Of the 418 participants enrolled in the open-label phase of the study, 411 (358 [87.1\%] women; mean [SD] age, 38.3 [10.4] years) were included in the safety analysis set. Of 275 randomized lisdexamfetamine responders (placebo, n\,=\,138; lisdexamfetamine, n\,=\,137), the observed proportions of participants meeting relapse criteria were 3.7\% (5 of 136) for lisdexamfetamine and 32.1\% (42 of 131) for placebo. Lisdexamfetamine demonstrated superiority over placebo on the log-rank test ({$\chi$}21, 40.37; P\,{$<$}\,.001) for time to relapse; the hazard ratio, based on a Cox proportional hazards model for lisdexamfetamine vs placebo, was 0.09 (95\% CI, 0.04-0.23). The treatment-emergent adverse events observed were generally consistent with the known profile of lisdexamfetamine. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Risk of binge-eating relapse over 6 months was lower in participants continuing lisdexamfetamine than in those randomized to placebo. The hazard for relapse was lower with lisdexamfetamine than placebo. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02009163.},

Data was collected online during the Argentinean quarantine. We calculated one-way between-groups ANOVA with Tukey's post hoc test.Results: Regionally, the center and the most populated area differed in psychological well-being/discomfort and negative alcohol-related consequences, but not in the remaining MHS indicators. According to the quarantine sub-periods, there were differences in psychological well-being/discomfort, social functioning and coping, psychological distress, and negative alcohol-related consequences. Negative alcohol-related consequences were the only MHS indicator improving over time. For all of the remaining MHS indicators, we found a similar deterioration pattern in the course of time, with mean scores decreasing from the first to the 2nd week of the quarantine pre-extensions, then increasing toward the 1st week of the quarantine post-extension (with some MHS indicators reaching mean scores worse than the start), and then continued to increase.Conclusion: A worsened mean MHS during quarantine suggests that quarantine and its extensions contribute to negative mental health impacts.},

  abstract = {The use of nonhuman animals (hereinafter ``animals'') for the benefit of humans and other animals is a contentious subject throughout many of the world's countries. Cultural morals and traditions, the status of animals in various religions, individual and cultural ethical values, and the diversity of concern for specific species (including the perceptions about the ``warm and fuzzies'' [e.g., dogs and cats] versus the ``creepy-crawlies'' [e.g., mice, rats, and reptiles]) all contribute significantly to the complexity of addressing moral (rightness or wrongness) and ethical (what ought to be) issues involved when considering the use of animals in biomedical research, teaching, and testing activities (hereinafter ``biomedical activities''). Further, it is most certainly difficult, if not impossible, to define what the moral status of sentient animals (species that can feel pain and suffer), creatures that are not persons yet not mere things, should be that would be universally accepted. These factors also contribute to the complexity of the regulatory climate in the numerous countries in which there is some sort of oversight of animal use in biomedical activities (see Attachment I for examples of U.S. laws, regulations, and guidelines and the list of worldwide regulations [excluding the United States] compiled by AAALAC International) (AAALAC International 2015).},

  abstract = {RATIONALE: In party circuits dexamphetamine is frequently used in combination with alcohol. It is hypothesized that co-administration of dexamphetamine to alcohol might reduce the sedative effects of alcohol, but may potentiate risk-taking behaviour. OBJECTIVES: The study was aimed at assessing the effects of alcohol, dexamphetamine and the combination of both on simulated driving and cognitive performance. METHOD: Eighteen subjects participated in a randomized, crossover, placebo-controlled study employing four conditions: 10 mg dexamphetamine, 0.8 g/kg alcohol, 10 mg dexamphetamine + 0.8 g/kg alcohol, and placebo. Fundamental driving skills and risk-taking behaviour were assessed in a driving simulator. Subjects also completed vigilance and divided attention tasks, and subjective ratings. RESULTS: Mean BAC levels during simulated driving were between 0.91\textperthousand{} and 0.64\textperthousand. Subjects using alcohol showed a significantly larger mean standard deviation of lateral position and shorter accepted gap time and distance. Use of alcohol or dexamphetamine + alcohol was associated with a higher frequency of red light running and collisions than the dexamphetamine or placebo conditions. Performance of vigilance and divided attention tasks was significantly impaired in the alcohol condition and, to a lesser degree, in the dexamphetamine + alcohol condition. CONCLUSION: Single doses of 0.8 g/kg alcohol increased risk-taking behaviours and impaired tracking, attention and reaction time during a 3-h period after drinking when BACs declined from 0.9 to 0.2 mg/ml. The stimulatory effects of co-administration of dexamphetamine 10 mg were not sufficient to overcome the impairing effects of alcohol on skills related to driving.},
